## Intro (Game Rule)
The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24.

The game is played with a deck of 52 cards, each card has a number from 1 to 13, and four cards are drawn.

The game is played by rearranging the numbers and using the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to form an expression that equals 24.
